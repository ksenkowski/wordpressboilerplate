# Wordpress Boilerplate

A boilerplate Wordpress theme that is designed to let me rapidly spin up a blank Wordpress theme. It is based on [HTML5Blank](https://github.com/toddmotto/html5blank) and [WPGulp](https://github.com/ahmadawais/WPGulpTheme).

## Setup
Uses gulp with browsersync to monitor the assets folder updating as changes are made. In the future I will likely add a watch on the PHP files.

You will need a server tool to run Wordpress (e.g. MAMP, LAMP, WAMP). Once you have set up your Wordpress instance on that tool, download a copy of this repo to your themes folder and run npm install in terminal. Once completed you simply have to run the gulp command to set the watcher.
